Unfortunately the only reliable mechanism for communication with arbitrary endpoints is a stream of bytes. \n",

To reference the previous lesson again, there is no way to represent the Euro symbol in a single byte.

Sometimes people just use the default encoding (which by default is `UTF-8` for Python), and even that policy goes a long way. Some network protocols like HTTP allow headers to specifiy the encoding of some or all of the message content. We will disregard that question from now on.\n",

The answer is that the byte string `b1` represents an ___encoding___ of the (Unicode) string `'Please pay €9.99 at exit'`. The `io.TextWrapper` object `o_f` took your Unicode string and turned it into a sequence of bytes. In fact the three-byte string `'\\xe2\\x82\\xac'` is how the code point is encoded in a scheme known as ___UTF-8___.\n",
